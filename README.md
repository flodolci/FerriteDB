# FerriteDB

FerriteDB is a Database Management System (DBMS) being developped from scratch in Rust. This project aims to build a simple and powerful relational database with support for ACID properties, indexing, and SQL-like query language.

## Introduction

Welcome to FerriteDB! This project is an ambition side-project to create a DBMS from the ground up using Rust. Follow along as we explore the intricacies of database internals, from storage engines to query processors and transaction management.

## Features

* In-memory and persistent storage engine
* ACID transaction support
* SQL-like query language parser and execution engine
* Indexing for optimized query performance

## Architecture 

FerriteDB is designed with the following core components:

* **Storage Engine:** Handles data storage and retrieval using efficient data structures.
* **Query Processor:** Parses and executes queries, returning results to the user.
* **Transaction Manager:** Ensures data consistency and supports concurrent transactions.
* **Indexing:** Provides indexing mechanisms to speed up data retrieval.
